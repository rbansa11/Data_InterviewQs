Suppose you’re an analyst for an e-commerce store. You’re trying to identify the top selling products in Q4 2017 by region, 
and you have 2 tables that you can query:

Table: all_products

Column Name	    Data Type	    Description
product_id	    integer	      id of the product
product_name	  string	      name of the product
sku	            integer	      universal stock keeping unit number
distributor_id	integer	      id for distributor

Table: orders

Column Name	    Data Type	    Description
date	          string	      format is "YYYY-MM-DD"
user_id	        integer	      id of purchaser
order_id	      integer	      id of order number
product_id	    integer	      id of product
no_units	      integer	      number of units sold in the order
price	          integer     	price per item
shipping_id	    integer     	id of shipment
region	        string	      region being shipped to

Using the tables above, write a SQL query to find the top 5 selling products (in terms of total units sold) by region in Q4 of 2017. 
Include both the distributor id as well as the name of the product in your results.
